## Overview

In this repo, we provide labels for the open-source dataset used in the paper "Topology-Preserving Automatic Labeling of Coronary Arteries via Anatomy-aware Connection Classifier".


## :point_right: Get Started

Given a vessel tree, we can split it into *segments* using *bifurcation rules* illustrated in fig.1. That is, we use consecutive *bifurcation points* to mark the boundary of one vessel segment. Each of the vessel segment has only ONE class. 

In our setting, we only consider the *centerlines* of vessels. Therefore, we only store point sets of vessel centerlines in our label files, and our goal is to classify each of the *centerline segments. The labeling of vessels can be simply done by a knn mapping.

The labels are stored in .json files, and each json has the following structure:

```python
{
  l_points=[{point_set=[[...]], cls=c},...],
  r_points=[{point_set=[[...]], cls=c'},...],
  l_tree=[[x,y],...], 
  r_tree=[[x',y'],...]
}
```

*l_points*: A list containing centerline point coordinates and the vessel segment labels of l_tree. Each element of the list is a dictionary with 2 fields: point_set (all centerline point coordinates of this vessel segment of the shape N*3) and cls (label of this segment).

*r_points*: A list containing centerline point coordinates and the vessel segment labels of r_tree. Each element of the list is a dictionary with 2 fields: point_set (all centerline point coordinates of this vessel segment of the shape N*3) and cls (label of this segment).

*l_tree*: A list storing the structure of l_tree, each element [x, y] is an edge of the tree, where x is the x-th segment in l_points and y is the y-th segment in l_points.

*r_tree*: A list storing the structure of r_tree, each element [x, y] is an edge of the tree, where x is the x-th segment in r_points and y is the y-th segment in r_points.

## :grey_question: How to Use
[Note: The maintenance peirod of this repo is 2023-05-31 to 2024-09-30. After 2024-09-30 this repo will NOT be maintained.]

You may clone this repo, and unzip labels.zip to see the labels. The password to unzip the .zip file can be found at **[here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c48DmEv_K0RWhh8UkaDJFA?pwd=eb3v)** with code eb3v. After unzipping the files, you need to *align the label files with the images*. The file name of the labels are the same as the corresponding images. Note that you probably need to reverse (and/or) swap the images' axis to align them. Before training your model, you should visualize the images and labels to ensure the alignment is correct.

You need to download the original open-source dataset, we CANNOT provide you the original dataset.

Here we provide a sample code for alignment:

```python
import os, numpy, json

def load_json(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    return data
def load_image(file_path):
    ...
    return image

img=IMG_PATH
label=LABEL_PATH
out_path=OUT_PATH
os.makedirs(out_path, exist_ok=True)
f=os.listdir(img)
# Somehow filter out irrelevent files in f
for f_ in f:
	fid = f_.split('.')[0]
    image = load_img(os.path.join(img, f_))
    h, w, d = image.shape
    lb = load_json(os.path.join(label, fid+'.json'))
    
    for s in lb['l_points']:
        point=s['point_set']
		# reverse w axis for example
		point[:, 1] = w - point[:, 1]
	for s in lb['r_points']:
        point=s['point_set']
		# reverse w axis for example
		point[:, 1] = w - point[:, 1]
	
	# you can adjust spacing here
	...
	
	np.savez_compressed(os.path.join(out_path, fid+'.npz'), img=image, label=lb)
```
